"REPL stands for Read Evaluate Print Loop, and is the name given to the "
"interactive MicroPython prompt that you can access on the WiPy.  Using "
"the REPL is by far the easiest way to test out your code and run "
"commands. You can use the REPL in addition to writing scripts in "
"``main.py``."

"To use the REPL, you must connect to the WiPy either via :ref:`telnet "
"<wipy_telnet>`, or with a USB to serial converter wired to one of the two"
" UARTs on the WiPy. To enable REPL duplication on UART0 (the one "
"accessible via the expansion board) do::"
