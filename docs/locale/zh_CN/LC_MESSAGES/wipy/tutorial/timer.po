"Timers can be used for a great variety of tasks, calling a function "
"periodically, counting events, and generating a PWM signal are among the "
"most common use cases. Each timer consists of two 16-bit channels and "
"this channels can be tied together to form one 32-bit timer. The "
"operating mode needs to be configured per timer, but then the period (or "
"the frequency) can be independently configured on each channel. By using "
"the callback method, the timer event can call a Python function."
