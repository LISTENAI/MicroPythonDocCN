"Be gentle when plugging/unplugging the USB cable.  Whilst the USB "
"connector is well soldered and is relatively strong, if it breaks off it "
"can be very difficult to fix."

"Static electricity can shock the components on the WiPy and destroy them."
" If you experience a lot of static electricity in your area (eg dry and "
"cold climates), take extra care not to shock the WiPy.  If your WiPy came"
" in a ESD bag, then this bag is the best way to store and carry the WiPy "
"as it will protect it against static discharges."

"As long as you take care of the hardware, you should be okay.  It's "
"almost impossible to break the software on the WiPy, so feel free to play"
" around with writing code as much as you like.  If the filesystem gets "
"corrupt, see below on how to reset it. In the worst case you might need "
"to do a safe boot, which is explained in detail in "
":ref:`wipy_boot_modes`."

"The expansion board can power the WiPy via USB. The WiPy comes with a "
"sticker on top of the RF shield that labels all pins, and this should "
"match the label numbers on the expansion board headers. When plugging it "
"in, the WiPy antenna will end up on top of the SD card connector of the "
"expansion board. A video showing how to do this can be found `here on "
"YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47D9MZ9zFQw>`_."
