"The data directive creates n array of data values in memory. The first "
"argument specifies the size in bytes of the subsequent arguments. Hence "
"the first statement below will cause the assembler to put three bytes "
"(with values 2, 3 and 4) into consecutive memory locations while the "
"second will cause it to emit two four byte words."

"Align the following instruction to an nBytes value. ARM Thumb-2 "
"instructions must be two byte aligned, hence it's advisable to issue "
"``align(2)`` after ``data`` directives and prior to any subsequent code. "
"This ensures that the code will run irrespective of the size of the data "
"array."
