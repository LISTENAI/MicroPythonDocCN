"This document assumes some familiarity with assembly language programming"
" and should be read after studying the :ref:`tutorial "
"<pyboard_tutorial_assembler>`. For a detailed description of the "
"instruction set consult the Architecture Reference Manual detailed below."
" The inline assembler supports a subset of the ARM Thumb-2 instruction "
"set described here. The syntax tries to be as close as possible to that "
"defined in the above ARM manual, converted to Python function calls."

"Instructions operate on 32 bit signed integer data except where stated "
"otherwise. Most supported instructions operate on registers ``R0-R7`` "
"only: where ``R8-R15`` are supported this is stated. Registers ``R8-R12``"
" must be restored to their initial value before return from a function. "
"Registers ``R13-R15`` constitute the Link Register, Stack Pointer and "
"Program Counter respectively."
