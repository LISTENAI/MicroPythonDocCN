"All the modules included in the firmware are available via ``import`` "
"from Python code.  The extra modules written in Python that are included "
"in a build (the last point above) are called *frozen modules*, and are "
"specified by a ``manifest.py`` file.  Changing this manifest requires "
"rebuilding the firmware."

"It's also possible to add additional modules to the filesystem of the "
"device once it is up and running.  Adding and removing modules to/from "
"the filesystem does not require rebuilding the firmware so is a simpler "
"process than rebuilding firmware.  The benefit of using a manifest is "
"that frozen modules are more efficient: they are faster to import and "
"take up less RAM once imported."
