"Notation: ``Rt, Rn`` denote ARM registers R0-R7 except where stated. "
"``immN`` represents an immediate value having a width of N bits hence "
"``imm5`` is constrained to the range 0-31. ``[Rn + immN]`` is the "
"contents of the memory address obtained by adding Rn and the offset "
"``immN``. Offsets are measured in bytes. These instructions affect the "
"condition flags."

"The specified immediate offsets are measured in bytes. Hence in the case "
"of ``ldr`` the 7 bit value enables 32 bit word aligned values to be "

" bit value enables 16 bit half-word aligned values to be accessed with a "
"maximum offset of 31 half-words."
