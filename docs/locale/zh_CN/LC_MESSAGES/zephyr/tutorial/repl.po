"REPL stands for Read Evaluate Print Loop, and is the name given to the "
"interactive MicroPython prompt that you can access on your board through "
"Zephyr. It is recommended to use REPL to test out your code and run "
"commands."

msgid ""
"The REPL is available on a UART serial peripheral specified for the board"
" by the ``zephyr,console`` devicetree node. The baudrate of the REPL is "
"115200. If your board has a USB-serial convertor on it then you should be"
" able to access the REPL directly from your PC."

"To access the prompt over USB-serial you will need to use a terminal "

"You can also try ``picocom`` or ``minicom`` instead of screen. You may "
"have to use ``/dev/ttyACM1`` or a higher number for ``ttyACM``. "
"Additional permissions may be necessary to access this device (eg group "
"``uucp`` or ``dialout``, or use sudo). For Windows, get a terminal "
"software, such as puTTY and connect via a serial session using the proper"
" COM port."
