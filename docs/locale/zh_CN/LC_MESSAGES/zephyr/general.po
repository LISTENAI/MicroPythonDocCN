"There is a multitude of modules and boards from different sources that "
"are supported by the Zephyr OS. All boards supported by Zephyr (with "
"standard level of features support, like UART console) should work with "
"MicroPython (but not all were tested). The FRDM-K64f board is taken as a "
"reference board for the port for this documentation. If you have another "
"board, please make sure you have a datasheet, schematics and other "
"reference materials for your board handy to look up various aspects of "
"your board functioning."
