"APA102 LEDs, also known as DotStar LEDs, are individually addressable "
"full-colour RGB LEDs, generally in a string formation. They differ from "
"NeoPixels in that they require two pins to control - both a Clock and "
"Data pin. They can operate at a much higher data and PWM frequencies than"
" NeoPixels and are more suitable for persistence-of-vision effects."

"The RGB colour data, as well as a brightness level, is sent to the APA102"
" in a certain order.  Usually this is ``(Red, Green, Blue, Brightness)``."
" If you are using one of the newer APA102C LEDs the green and blue are "
"swapped, so the order is ``(Red, Blue, Green, Brightness)``. The APA102 "
"has more of a square lens while the APA102C has more of a round one. If "
"you are using a APA102C strip and would prefer to provide colours in RGB "
"order instead of RBG, you can customise the tuple colour order like so::"
