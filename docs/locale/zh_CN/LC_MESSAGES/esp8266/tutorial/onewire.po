"The 1-wire bus is a serial bus that uses just a single wire for "
"communication (in addition to wires for ground and power).  The DS18B20 "
"temperature sensor is a very popular 1-wire device, and here we show how "
"to use the onewire module to read from such a device."

"For the following code to work you need to have at least one DS18S20 or "
"DS18B20 temperature sensor with its data line connected to GPIO12.  You "
"must also power the sensors and connect a 4.7k Ohm resistor between the "
"data pin and the power pin.  ::"
