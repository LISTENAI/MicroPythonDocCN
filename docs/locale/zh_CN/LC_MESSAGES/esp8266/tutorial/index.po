"The tutorial does not assume that you know Python, but it also does not "
"attempt to explain any of the details of the Python language.  Instead it"
" provides you with commands that are ready to run, and hopes that you "
"will gain a bit of Python knowledge along the way.  To learn more about "
"Python itself please refer to `<https://www.python.org>`__."
