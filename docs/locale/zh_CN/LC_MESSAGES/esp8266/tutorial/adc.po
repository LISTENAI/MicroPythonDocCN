"The ESP8266 has a single pin (separate to the GPIO pins) which can be "
"used to read analog voltages and convert them to a digital value.  You "
"can construct such an ADC pin object using::"

"The values returned from the ``read()`` function are between 0 (for 0.0 "
"volts) and 1024 (for 1.0 volts).  Please note that this input can only "
"tolerate a maximum of 1.0 volts and you must use a voltage divider "
"circuit to measure larger voltages."
