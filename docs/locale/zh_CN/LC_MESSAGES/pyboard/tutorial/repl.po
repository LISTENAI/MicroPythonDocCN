"REPL stands for Read Evaluate Print Loop, and is the name given to the "
"interactive MicroPython prompt that you can access on the pyboard.  Using"
" the REPL is by far the easiest way to test out your code and run "
"commands. You can use the REPL in addition to writing scripts in "
"``main.py``."

#: ../../pyboard/tutorial/repl.rst:9

"To use the REPL, you must connect to the serial USB device on the "
"pyboard. How you do this depends on your operating system."

"You need to install the pyboard driver to use the serial USB device. The "
"driver is on the pyboard's USB flash drive, and is called ``pybcdc.inf``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pyboard/tutorial/repl.rst:18
msgid ""
"To install this driver you need to go to Device Manager for your "
"computer, find the pyboard in the list of devices (it should have a "
"warning sign next to it because it's not working yet), right click on the"
" pyboard device, select Properties, then Install Driver.  You need to "
"then select the option to find the driver manually (don't use Windows "
"auto update), navigate to the pyboard's USB drive, and select that.  It "
"should then install. After installing, go back to the Device Manager to "
"find the installed pyboard, and see which COM port it is (eg COM4). More "
"comprehensive instructions can be found in the `Guide for pyboard on "
"Windows (PDF) <http://micropython.org/resources/Micro-Python-Windows-"
"setup.pdf>`_. Please consult this guide if you are having problems "
"installing the driver."

"You now need to run your terminal program.  You can use HyperTerminal if "
"you have it installed, or download the free program PuTTY: `putty.exe "
"<http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html>`_. "
"Using your serial program you must connect to the COM port that you found"
" in the previous step.  With PuTTY, click on \"Session\" in the left-hand"
" panel, then click the \"Serial\" radio button on the right, then enter "
"you COM port (eg COM4) in the \"Serial Line\" box.  Finally, click the "
"\"Open\" button."
