"A pin used as input from a switch or other mechanical device can have a "
"lot of noise on it, rapidly changing from low to high when the switch is "
"first pressed or released.  This noise can be eliminated using a "
"capacitor (a debouncing circuit).  It can also be eliminated using a "
"simple function that makes sure the value on the pin is stable."

"The following function does just this.  It gets the current value of the "
"given pin, and then waits for the value to change.  The new pin value "
"must be stable for a continuous 20ms for it to register the change.  You "
"can adjust this time (to say 50ms) if you still have noise. ::"
