"The pyboard has an accelerometer (a tiny mass on a tiny spring) that can "
"be used to detect the angle of the board and motion. There is a different"
" sensor for each of the x, y, z directions. To get the value of the "
"accelerometer, create a pyb.Accel() object and then call the x() method. "

"This returns a signed integer with a value between around -30 and 30. "
"Note that the measurement is very noisy, this means that even if you keep"
" the board perfectly still there will be some variation in the number "
"that you measure. Because of this, you shouldn't use the exact value of "
"the x() method but see if it is in a certain range."

"We create Accel and LED objects, then get the value of the x direction of"
" the accelerometer. If the magnitude of x is bigger than a certain value "
"``SENSITIVITY``, then the LED turns on, otherwise it turns off. The loop "
"has a small ``pyb.delay()`` otherwise the LED flashes annoyingly when the"
" value of x is close to ``SENSITIVITY``. Try running this on the pyboard "
"and tilt the board left and right to make the LED turn on and off."

"**Exercise: Change the above script so that the blue LED gets brighter "
"the more you tilt the pyboard.  HINT: You will need to rescale the "
"values, intensity goes from 0-255.**"

"The example above is only sensitive to the angle in the x direction but "
"if we use the ``y()`` value and more LEDs we can turn the pyboard into a "
"spirit level. ::"

#: ../../pyboard/tutorial/accel.rst:87
msgid ""
"We start by creating a tuple of LED objects for the x and y directions. "
"Tuples are immutable objects in python which means they can't be modified"
" once they are created. We then proceed as before but turn on a different"
" LED for positive and negative x values. We then do the same for the y "
"direction. This isn't particularly sophisticated but it does the job. Run"
" this on your pyboard and you should see different LEDs turning on "
"depending on how you tilt the board."
