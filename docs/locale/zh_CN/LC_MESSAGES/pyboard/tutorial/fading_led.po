"In addition to turning LEDs on and off, it is also possible to control "
"the brightness of an LED using `Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) "
"<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation>`_, a common "
"technique for obtaining variable output from a digital pin. This allows "

"You may have noticed that the LED brightness seems to fade slowly, but "
"increases quickly. This is because our eyes interprets brightness "
"logarithmically (`Weber's Law <http://www.telescope-"
"optics.net/eye_intensity_response.htm>`_ ), while the LED's brightness "
"changes linearly, that is by the same amount each time. How do you solve "

"We could have also used the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) to achieve "
"the same effect. The PWM method has the advantage that it drives the LED "
"with the same current each time, but for different lengths of time. This "
"allows better control over the brightness, because LEDs do not "
"necessarily exhibit a linear relationship between the driving current and"
" brightness."
