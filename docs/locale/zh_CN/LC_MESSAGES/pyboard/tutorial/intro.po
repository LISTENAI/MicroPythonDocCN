"Static electricity can shock the components on the pyboard and destroy "
"them. If you experience a lot of static electricity in your area (eg dry "
"and cold climates), take extra care not to shock the pyboard.  If your "
"pyboard came in a black plastic box, then this box is the best way to "
"store and carry the pyboard as it is an anti-static box (it is made of a "
"conductive plastic, with conductive foam inside)."

"As long as you take care of the hardware, you should be okay.  It's "
"almost impossible to break the software on the pyboard, so feel free to "
"play around with writing code as much as you like.  If the filesystem "
"gets corrupt, see below on how to reset it.  In the worst case you might "
"need to reflash the MicroPython software, but that can be done over USB."

"The micro USB connector is on the top right, the micro SD card slot on "

"blue on the top.  There are 2 switches: the right one is the reset "
