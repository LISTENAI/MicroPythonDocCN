"This chapter describes options for implementing additional functionality "
"in C, but from code written outside of the main MicroPython repository. "
"The first approach is useful for building your own custom firmware with "
"some project-specific additional modules or functions that can be "
"accessed from Python. The second approach is for building modules that "
"can be loaded at runtime."

"本章节描述在来自非主 MicroPython "
"仓库中写的 C 代码实现额外功能的选项。"
"第一种可生效的方法是建立自己的自定义固件，其中包含"
"一些项目特定的附加模块或函数，可以从 Python 中访问。第二种方法"
"是建立可以在运行时加载的模块。"
