"This chapter describes options for implementing additional functionality "
"in C, but from code written outside of the main MicroPython repository. "
"The first approach is useful for building your own custom firmware with "
"some project-specific additional modules or functions that can be "
"accessed from Python. The second approach is for building modules that "
"can be loaded at runtime."
