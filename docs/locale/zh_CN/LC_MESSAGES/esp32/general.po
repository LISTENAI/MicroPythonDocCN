"There is a multitude of modules and boards from different sources which "
"carry the ESP32 chip. MicroPython tries to provide a generic port which "
"would run on as many boards/modules as possible, but there may be "
"limitations. Espressif development boards are taken as reference for the "
"port (for example, testing is performed on them).  For any board you are "
"using please make sure you have a datasheet, schematics and other "
"reference materials so you can look up any board-specific functions."
