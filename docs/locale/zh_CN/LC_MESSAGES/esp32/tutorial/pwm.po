msgid ""
"Pulse width modulation (PWM) is a way to get an artificial analog output "
"on a digital pin.  It achieves this by rapidly toggling the pin from low "
"to high. There are two parameters associated with this: the frequency of "
"the toggling, and the duty cycle.  The duty cycle is defined to be how "
"long the pin is high compared with the length of a single period (low "
"plus high time).  Maximum duty cycle is when the pin is high all of the "
"time, and minimum is when it is low all of the time."
