"Set or query the additional GC allocation threshold. Normally, a "
"collection is triggered only when a new allocation cannot be satisfied, "
"i.e. on an out-of-memory (OOM) condition. If this function is called, in "
"addition to OOM, a collection will be triggered each time after *amount* "
"bytes have been allocated (in total, since the previous time such an "
"amount of bytes have been allocated). *amount* is usually specified as "
"less than the full heap size, with the intention to trigger a collection "
"earlier than when the heap becomes exhausted, and in the hope that an "
"early collection will prevent excessive memory fragmentation. This is a "
"heuristic measure, the effect of which will vary from application to "
"application, as well as the optimal value of the *amount* parameter."
