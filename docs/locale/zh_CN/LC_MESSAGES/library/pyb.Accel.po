"The accelerometer uses I2C bus 1 to communicate with the processor. "
"Consequently when readings are being taken pins X9 and X10 should be "
"unused (other than for I2C). Other devices using those pins, and which "
"therefore cannot be used concurrently, are UART 1 and Timer 4 channels 1 "
"and 2."
