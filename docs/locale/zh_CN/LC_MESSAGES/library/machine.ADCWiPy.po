"This class is a non-standard ADC implementation for the WiPy. It is "
"available simply as ``machine.ADC`` on the WiPy but is named in the "
"documentation below as ``machine.ADCWiPy`` to distinguish it from the "
"more general :ref:`machine.ADC <machine.ADC>` class."

"ADC pin input range is 0-1.4V (being 1.8V the absolute maximum that it "
