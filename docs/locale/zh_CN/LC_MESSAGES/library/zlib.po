"This module allows to decompress binary data compressed with `DEFLATE "
"algorithm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFLATE>`_ (commonly used in "
"zlib library and gzip archiver). Compression is not yet implemented."

"Return decompressed *data* as bytes. *wbits* is DEFLATE dictionary window"
" size used during compression (8-15, the dictionary size is power of 2 of"
" that value). Additionally, if value is positive, *data* is assumed to be"
" zlib stream (with zlib header). Otherwise, if it's negative, it's "
"assumed to be raw DEFLATE stream. *bufsize* parameter is for "
"compatibility with CPython and is ignored."

"Create a `stream` wrapper which allows transparent decompression of "
"compressed data in another *stream*. This allows to process compressed "
"streams with data larger than available heap size. In addition to values "
"described in :func:`decompress`, *wbits* may take values 24..31 (16 + "
"8..15), meaning that input stream has gzip header."
