"The Zephyr disk access class enables the transfer of data between a disk "
"device and an accessible memory buffer given a disk name, buffer, "
"starting disk block, and number of sectors to read. MicroPython reads as "
"many blocks as necessary to fill the buffer, so the number of sectors to "
"read is found by dividing the buffer length by block size of the disk."

"Gets an object for accessing disk memory of the specific disk. For "
"accessing an SD card on the mimxrt1050_evk, ``disk_name`` would be "
"``SDHC``. See board documentation and devicetree for usable disk names "
"for your board (ex. RT boards use style USDHC#)."
