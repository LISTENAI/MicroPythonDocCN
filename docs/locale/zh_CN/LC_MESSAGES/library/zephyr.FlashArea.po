"This class allows access to device flash partition data. Flash area "
"structs consist of a globally unique ID number, the name of the flash "
"device the partition is in, the start offset (expressed in relation to "
"the flash memory beginning address per partition), and the size of the "
"partition that the device represents. For fixed flash partitions, data "
"from the device tree is used; however, fixed flash partitioning is not "
"enforced in MicroPython because MCUBoot is not enabled."

"``id`` values are integers correlating to fixed flash partitions defined "
"in the devicetree. A commonly used partition is the designated flash "
"storage area defined as ``FlashArea.STORAGE`` if "
"``FLASH_AREA_LABEL_EXISTS(storage)`` returns true at boot. Zephyr "
"devicetree fixed flash partitions are ``boot_partition``, "
"``slot0_partition``, ``slot1_partition``, and ``scratch_partition``. "
"Because MCUBoot is not enabled by default for MicroPython, these fixed "
"partitions can be accessed by ID integer values 1, 2, 3, and 4, "
"respectively."
