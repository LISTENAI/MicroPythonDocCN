"Not all frequencies can be generated with absolute accuracy due to the "
"discrete nature of the computing hardware.  Typically the PWM frequency "
"is obtained by dividing some integer base frequency by an integer "
"divider. For example, if the base frequency is 80MHz and the required PWM"
" frequency is 300kHz the divider must be a non-integer number 80000000 / "
"300000 = 266.67. After rounding the divider is set to 267 and the PWM "
"frequency will be 80000000 / 267 = 299625.5 Hz, not 300kHz.  If the "
"divider is set to 266 then the PWM frequency will be 80000000 / 266 = "
"300751.9 Hz, but again not 300kHz."

"The duty cycle has the same discrete nature and its absolute accuracy is "
"not achievable.  On most hardware platforms the duty will be applied at "
"the next frequency period.  Therefore, you should wait more than "
"\"1/frequency\" before measuring the duty."

"The frequency and the duty cycle resolution are usually interdependent. "
"The higher the PWM frequency the lower the duty resolution which is "
"available, and vice versa. For example, a 300kHz PWM frequency can have a"
" duty cycle resolution of 8 bit, not 16-bit as may be expected.  In this "
"case, the lowest 8 bits of *duty_u16* are insignificant. So::"
